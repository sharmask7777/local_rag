# Local LLM-based RAG System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a locally run Large Language Model (LLM) on macOS. It processes a directory of documents, creates embeddings, and allows for question-answering based on the document content.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- Homebrew
- Python 3.x
- Xcode Command Line Tools

## Installation

1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Install Homebrew (if not already installed):
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Install Python (if not already installed):
   ```
   brew install python
   ```

4. Create and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   mkdir llm_project
   cd llm_project
   ```

5. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

6. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install langchain chromadb sentence-transformers llama-cpp-python pypdf unstructured
   ```

7. Install additional system dependencies:
   ```
   brew install libmagic poppler tesseract
   ```

8. Add Homebrew to PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):
   ```
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
   ```
   Run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` after adding.

9. Download a GGUF model:
   ```
   mkdir models
   cd models
   wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf
   cd ..
   ```

## Project Structure

```
llm_project/
│
├── venv/
├── models/
│   └── llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf
├── documents/
│   └── (your PDF documents here)
└── rag_script.py
```

## Usage

1. Place your PDF documents in the `documents` directory.

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python rag_script.py
   ```

3. The script will process the documents, create embeddings, and set up a question-answering system.

4. You can modify the query in the script to ask different questions about your documents.

## Troubleshooting

### libmagic error
If you encounter `ImportError: failed to find libmagic`, try:
```
brew install libmagic
pip uninstall python-magic
pip install python-magic
```

### PDFInfoNotInstalledError
Ensure Poppler is installed and in your PATH:
```
brew install poppler
which pdfinfo  # Should return a path
```

### TesseractNotFoundError
Ensure Tesseract is installed and in your PATH:
```
brew install tesseract
which tesseract  # Should return a path
```

You may need to set the Tesseract path in your script:
```python
import pytesseract
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/opt/homebrew/bin/tesseract'
```

## Redownloading Dependencies

To reinstall all dependencies:

1. Generate a requirements file:
   ```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. Remove all packages:
   ```
   pip uninstall -y -r <(pip freeze)
   ```

3. Reinstall packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notes

- The performance of the local LLM depends on your Mac's specifications.
- Adjust the model size or settings if you encounter performance issues.
- GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) files are optimized for running LLMs on consumer hardware.
